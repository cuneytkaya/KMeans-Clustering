 KMeans Clustering and Visualization of Economic Data

Dataset: Euro_2024_Matches.csv([find on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nlztrk/trkiye-cumhuriyet-merkez-bankas-temel-verileri/data))

This project demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering on economic data, followed by various visualizations to interpret the clustering results. By using the elbow method, we can also determine the optimal number of clusters for our dataset. These steps provide a comprehensive approach to exploring and understanding patterns within economic data using machine learning techniques.
